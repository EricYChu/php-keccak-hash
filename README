Keccak hash function for PHP 
Version 0.1

Keccak (pronounced [kɛtʃak], like “ketchak”) is a family of hash functions that
has been submitted as candidate to NIST's hash algorithm competition (SHA-3)
and selected as one of the five finalists.  Keccak can be considered as a
successor of RadioGatún; However, it has a very different design philosophy.

The author of this extension was in no way involved in the development of the
Keccak hash function. The hash source code was taken directly from NIST
submission package with a few minor variable name changes so that it would play
nice with PHP.

See the CREDITS section for more details.

= INSTALLATION =

You'll need to have the PHP 5 development package and a working build
environment to compile this module.

To compile and install the PHP extension:

   phpize
   ./configure --enable-keccak
   make
   sudo make install

Then add the following to your php.ini file:

   extension=keccak.so

To build the keccak-cli program:

    gcc -g -O2 keccak-cli.c  KeccakF-1600-opt64.c  KeccakNISTInterface.c KeccakSponge.c -o keccak-cli

= USAGE =

Function Description:
   
   string keccak_hash(string $string [, int bit_length = 512])

Example:

   // Build a base-64 encoded hash
   $hash = base64_encode(keccak_hash('Hello, world.'));

= LICENSE =

The SHA-3 Submission Requirements states:

   "Each submitted algorithm must be available worldwide on a royalty free
   basis during the period of the hash function competition."

If the algorithm is selected as the winner of the competition, the following
applies: 

   "an irrevocable nonexclusive royalty-free license to practice the referenced
   algorithm, reference implementation or the optimized implementations"

If the algorithm is not selected as the winner, the license will be determined
by the team.
